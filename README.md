## HH Branding

The directory `branding` is where you'll find up-to-date variations of the Hack.Hands() logo.

#### Other Assets

In addition to the Hack.Hands() assets provided, I figured it might be handy to provide a few additional resources that may assist you in putting your own unique spin on the branding.

- [Flat Circle Portraits](http://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/1090-flatflow-icons-sketch-resource-freebie.html)
- [Hipster Vector Pack](http://www.designshock.com/hipster-vector/)



## HH Typeface

HH currently takes advantage of the [Whitney Typeface](https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/whitney).


#### Free Font Alternatives

Inside of the _fonts_ directory there are a collection of font families I've found work well when creating custom graphics or elements to upload to the web.

A common replacement for Whitney is the **Open Sans** font-family.  You can download it [here](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans).

Another font-family that works great is **PT Sans**, also available on [google fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/PT+Sans).
